Of course. Here is the updated `README.md` file.

The changes reflect that the data generator is complete and the first model, the `RowBasedTransformer`, has been implemented. The development plan is updated to show this progress and highlight the next steps.

# Tabular Architecture Playground

This repository is my personal exploration into building a general-purpose, pre-trained model for tabular data. The core idea is to train a single, powerful neural network on a vast amount of synthetically generated datasets, with the goal of creating a model that can solve new, unseen tabular problems "in-context" without the need for fine-tuning.

## The Core Idea: In-Context Learning for Tables

Traditional machine learning involves training a specific model for each specific task (e.g., a churn model, a credit risk model). This project explores a different paradigm:

1.  **Phase 1: Pre-training.** A neural network architecture is trained on thousands of diverse, synthetically generated tabular classification problems. The model is not learning to solve any single problem, but rather learning a general-purpose *algorithm* for how to deduce patterns from tabular data.

2.  **Phase 2: Inference.** The single, pre-trained model is presented with a new, unseen problem. The entire training set for this new problem is provided as a "prompt" or "context" to the model in a single forward pass. The model uses its learned algorithm to infer the underlying patterns from the prompt and make predictions on the test samples provided.

The primary goal is to experiment with different neural network architectures to see which ones are most effective at learning this general "tabular reasoning" algorithm.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into a few key components:

-   `data_generator.py`: A script responsible for creating an infinite stream of diverse, synthetic tabular classification datasets. It uses `scikit-learn` to generate data with various underlying structures (linear, clustered, non-linear) and complexities.

-   `architectures/`: This directory contains the implementation of the different neural network models.
    -   `row_transformer.py`: The first model implementation, a Transformer that treats each data row as a token.

-   `train.py`: *(Upcoming)* The main script for pre-training a chosen architecture on the synthetic data.

-   `evaluate.py`: *(Upcoming)* A script to benchmark the pre-trained models on a suite of real-world datasets to evaluate their generalization capabilities.

## My Architectural Experiments

The central part of this project is to implement and compare different architectures. My plan is to start with a baseline and then explore more creative ideas.

### 1. The Baseline: Row-Based Transformer

-   **Status:** Implemented in `architectures/row_transformer.py`.
-   **Concept:** This model treats each data point (a row) as a "token" in a sequence, similar to how words are treated in a sentence. A standard Transformer Encoder then processes the entire sequence of rows to learn the relationships between them.
-   **Implementation Details:**
    1.  **Row Embedder:** A simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that projects each input row vector into a higher-dimensional embedding space.
    2.  **Positional Encoding:** Standard sinusoidal positional encodings are added to give the model a sense of the order and position of rows in the sequence.
    3.  **Transformer Encoder Core:** The main workhorse is a stack of `torch.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer` modules, which perform the self-attention calculations.
    4.  **Output Head:** A final Linear layer maps the processed row embeddings to the classification logits for each class.

### 2. The Follow-up: Hybrid (CNN + Transformer)

-   **Status:** Planned.
-   **Concept:** Before feeding the sequence of row embeddings into the Transformer, first pass it through several layers of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
-   **Hypothesis:** The CNN layers can act as "local pattern extractors," identifying meaningful features among small, local groups of data points. The Transformer can then use these richer, pre-processed features to model the more complex, global relationships across the entire dataset.

## My Development Plan

-   [x] **Build a robust synthetic data generator.** The `data_generator.py` script is complete and functional.
-   [x] **Implement the Row-Based Transformer baseline.** The first architecture is coded in `architectures/row_transformer.py`.
-   [ ] **Develop the pre-training loop.** This is the immediate next step. This script will connect the data generator to the model and handle the in-context loss calculation and backpropagation.
-   [ ] **Establish an evaluation harness.** Create a standardized way to test the pre-trained model on a set of real-world tabular datasets.
-   [ ] **Iterate and experiment.** Once the baseline is established and evaluated, I will implement and test other architectures.

## How to Use

This project is currently in the development phase. You can run the individual components to see them in action.

**1. See an example of a generated dataset:**
```bash
python data_generator.py```

**2. Test the Row-Based Transformer model:**
This script will instantiate the model and run a forward pass with a dummy data tensor to verify its dimensions and functionality.
```bash
python architectures/row_transformer.py
```
